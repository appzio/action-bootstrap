# action-bootstrap
This is a bootstrap library for developing actions for Appzio using PHP. It includes an example module + some of the shared libraries. If you are developing for Appzio, contact devsupport@appzio.com to get your own server instance, sftp access and all the other related goodies. 


# Installing Yii
You don't need the Yii installed, but it will make your life little bit easier if you are using a proper IDE. If you have composer installed and working (sorry, need to use without https, if its not enabled do "php composer.phar config secure-http false" first.) Simply do "php composer.phar install". 

# Testing 
Good partner for this toolkit is the rest bootstrap library (https://github.com/appzio/rest-bootstrap-php) and iOS / Android application which is connected to your dev instance.
